# Python Machine Learning Projects

This repository hosts a collection of machine learning projects developed in Python using **Jupyter Notebooks**.  
Each project explores a different aspect of data preprocessing, model training, testing, and evaluation.  

The focus of these projects is on **building, testing, and validating ML models** to solve real-world problems while practicing best practices in software quality and reproducibility.

## 📂 Project Structure

- **Lab1/** – Introduction to supervised learning (Regression task)  
- **Lab2/** – Classification project with decision trees and logistic regression  
- **Lab3/** – Feature engineering, scaling, and handling missing data  
- **Lab4/** – Model comparison and cross-validation across multiple algorithms  
- **Lab5/** – End-to-end pipeline project (data cleaning → training → evaluation)  

*(Lab names can be updated to reflect the specific problem each lab addresses — e.g., “House Price Prediction,” “Customer Churn Analysis.”)*

## ✅ Features & QA Testing Practices

- Implemented **data validation checks** (missing values, duplicates, inconsistent data types)  
- Applied **edge case testing** (e.g., outlier handling, extreme values)  
- Documented workflows and results for **reproducibility**  
- Compared model performance using metrics (R², accuracy, confusion matrix)  
- Visualized results to detect anomalies and validate expected outcomes

## 📊 Example Outcomes

- Predicted continuous variables (regression) with improved accuracy through feature engineering.  
- Classified datasets with decision trees, logistic regression, and evaluated precision/recall.  
- Built comparative dashboards to analyze which models perform best across datasets.
